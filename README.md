# Optical Recognition

Our optical recognition software is designed for users to be able to automatically upload videos for analysis, extract key games data, store the data in a database, and utilize a dashboard so that they can use the system.

## Installation

We have registered our software to a domain name using domain registrar NameCheap so no installation and cloning repository is required. Below is the link to our optical recognition software:
